# Ioannis Chalkiadakis - Portfolio ðŸš€

Welcome to my portfolio!  Here, youâ€™ll find a curated list of projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning.

Most of these projects are exercises I completed as part of three certifications:
- **Google Advanced Data Analytics** 
- **Machine Learning Specialization**  
- **Deep Learning Specialization** 

These hands-on projects provided me with practical experience in exploring data, developing models, and solving real-world problems. While most projects were guided exercises, I approached them with a mindset of independent learning and experimentation to deepen my understanding. 

This portfolio is a testament to my dedication to mastering the field of data science and machine learning , and I hope it provides you with insights into my capabilities.
